        <p>You are an airplane pilot in WWII and you must make it as far as you can into enemy territory before time runs out in order to drop critical supplies to the soldiers hiding behind enemy spies! If you don't get close enough to the troops, you lose!</p>

<p>FlyFar is still in the development process! We apologize for the inconvenience. Please try again later.
If you would like to watch development of FlyFar, please go to to the GitHub project and click follow.</p>

<p>NOTICE: FlyFar is expected to go into the Beta stage between February 1st and February 31st. Until then, most features will most likely be inoperable or not yet added. Thank you for your patience.</p>
