{"name":"FlyFar","tagline":"Do you have what it takes to fly a plane in WWII, taking supplies to your comrades hidden behind enemy lines?","body":"You are an airplane pilot in WWII and you must make it as far as you can into enemy territory before time runs out in order to drop critical supplies to the soldiers hiding behind enemy spies! If you don't get close enough to the troops, you lose!\r\n\r\nFlyFar is still in the Alpha stage! We apologize for the inconvenience. Please try again later.\r\nIf you would like to watch development of FlyFar, please go to to the GitHub project and click follow or check out our [Development Watch](https://github.com/WebWonders/FlyFar/wiki/Development-Watch) page on the wiki.\r\n\r\nNOTICE: FlyFar is expected to go into the Beta stage between February 1st and February 31st. Until then, most features will most likely be inoperable or not yet added. Thank you for your patience.\r\nIf you would like to become a Beta tester, you can do one of two things: first, you can be an unofficial tester by simply downloading FlyFar to your computer, playing it, finding the bugs, thinking of ideas for things we should add, and going to [Issue #8](https://github.com/WebWonders/FlyFar/issues/8) to post your suggestions, comments, and bug finds; or you can become an official tester by going to [Issue #18](https://github.com/WebWonders/FlyFar/issues/18) and applying to become an official Beta tester! Please note that places to become official testers on the WebWonders team are fairly hard to get, so please take this in mind when applying for a position.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate all the views we can get here, so we'd love it if you would post a link to this page on your blog or website!
